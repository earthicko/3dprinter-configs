# moonraker.conf

[server]
host: 0.0.0.0
#  The host address in which to bind the HTTP server.  Default is to bind
#  to all interfaces
port: 7125
#   The port the HTTP server will listen on.  Default is 7125
# ssl_port: 7130
#   The port to listen on for SSS (HTTPS) connections.  Note that the HTTPS
#   server will only be started of the certificate and key options outlined
#   below are provied.  The default is 7130.
# ssl_certificate_path:
#   The path to a self signed ssl certificate.  The default is no path, which
#   disables HTTPS.
# ssl_key_path:
#   The path to the private key used to signed the certificate.  The default
#   is no path, which disables HTTPS.
klippy_uds_address: /tmp/klippy_uds
#   The address of Unix Domain Socket used to communicate with Klippy. Default
#   is /tmp/klippy_uds
max_upload_size: 1024
#   The maximum size allowed for a file upload (in MiB).  Default is 1024 MiB.
enable_debug_logging: False
#   When set to True Moonraker will log in verbose mode.  During this stage
#   of development the default is False.
config_path: ~/printer_config
#   The path to a directory where configuration files are located. This
#   directory may contain Klipper config files (printer.cfg) or Moonraker
#   config files (moonraker.conf).  Clients may also write their own config
#   files to this directory.  Note that this may not be the system root
#   (ie: "/") and moonraker must have read and write access permissions
#   for this directory.
database_path: ~/.moonraker_database
#   The path to the folder that stores Moonraker's lmdb database files.
#   It is NOT recommended to place this file in a location that is served by
#   Moonraker (such as the "config_path" or the location where gcode
#   files are stored).  If the folder does not exist an attempt will be made
#   to create it.  The default is ~/.moonraker_database.
# log_path:
#   An optional path to a directory where log files are located.  Users may
#   configure various applications to store logs here and Moonraker will serve
#   them at "/server/files/logs/*".  The default is no log paths.
enable_database_debug: False
#   For developer use only.  End users should leave this option set to False.
temperature_store_size: 1200
#   The maximum number of temperature values to store for each sensor. Note
#   that this value also applies to the "target", "power", and "fan_speed"
#   if the sensor reports them.  The default is 1200, which is enough to
#   store approximately 20 minutes of data at one value per second.
gcode_store_size:  1000
#   The maximum number "gcode lines" to store.  The default is 1000.
