[z_calibration]
nozzle_xy_position: 302, 298
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the nozzle, clicking on the z endstop.
switch_xy_position: 299, 276
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) of the probe's switch body, clicking on
#   the z endstop.
# bed_xy_position: 299, 253
#   A X, Y coordinate (e.g. 100,100) where the print surface (e.g. the center
#   point) is probed. These coordinates are adjusted by the
#   probe's X and Y offsets. The default is the zero_reference_position which
#   replaces the deprecated relative_reference_index
#   of the configured bed_mesh, if configured. It's possible to change the zero
#   reference position at runtime or use the GCode argument BED_POSITION of CALIBRATE_Z.
switch_offset: 0.50
#   switch_offset ++ -> nozzle to bed distance --
#   The trigger point offset of the used mag-probe switch.
#   This needs to be fined out manually. More on this later
#   in this section..
offset_margins: -2.5, 2.5
#   The minimum and maximum margins allowed for the calculated offset.
#   If the offset is outside these values, it will stop!
#   The margin can be defined as "min,max" e.g. "-0.5,1.5" or by just one
#   value e.g. "1.0" which translates to "-1.0,1.0" (which is also the default).
# max_deviation: DEPRECATED - please use offset_margins instead!
#   The maximum allowed deviation of the calculated offset.
#   If the offset exceeds this value, it will stop!
#   The default is 1.0 mm.
safe_z_height: 5
#   The absolute z position in mm to move to before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration. The minimum safe z height is 3mm.
# clearance: DEPRECATED - please use safe_z_height instead!
#   The distance in mm to move up before moving to the next
#   position. The default is two times the z_offset from the probe's
#   configuration.
# position_min: default from "stepper_z:position_min" section.
#   Minimum valid distance (in mm) used for probing move. The
#   default is from the Z rail configuration.
speed: 400
#   The moving speed in X and Y. The default is 50 mm/s.
lift_speed: 20
#   Speed (in mm/s) of the Z axis when lifting the probe between
#   samples and clearance moves. The default is from the probe's
#   configuration.
probing_speed: 20
#   The fast probing speed (in mm/s) used, when probing_first_fast
#   is activated. The default is from the Z rail configuration.
probing_second_speed: 2.5
#   The slower speed (in mm/s) for probing the recorded samples.
#   The default is second_homing_speed of the Z rail configuration.
probing_retract_dist: 1
#   Distance to backoff (in mm) before probing the next sample.
#   The default is homing_retract_dist from the Z rail configuration.
probing_first_fast: True
#   If true, the first probing is done faster by the probing speed.
#   This is to get faster down and the result is not recorded as a
#   probing sample. The default is false.
start_gcode: 
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   attach the probe.
before_switch_gcode:
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute prior to each probing on the
#   mag-probe. See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be
#   used to attach the probe after probing on the nozzle and before probing
#   on the mag-probe.
end_gcode: 
#   A list of G-Code commands to execute after each calibration command.
#   See docs/Command_Templates.md for G-Code format. This can be used to
#   detach the probe afterwards.
